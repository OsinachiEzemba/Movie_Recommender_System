- Develop an effective movie recommender system.
- Create a user-friendly app that seamlessly incorporates the recommender system.
- Present key findings to stakeholders for informed decision-making.
  
# Utilized Tools:
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2 with S3 bucket
  
# Final Output:
A demonstration of the application showcasing the successfully implemented movie recommender system, providing users with personalized recommendations based on their viewing history and preferences.
